New York Taxi fare predictions [ Kaggle Competition Data]
We'll train a machine learning model to predict a fare for taxi ride in New York given information like pick up date & time, pickup location, drop location and no. of passangers

This dataset is taken from kaggle competition organized by google cloud. It contains over 55 million rows of data. We attempt to achieve a respectable score in the competition using just a fraction of data. Along the way, we'll look at some practical tips for machine learning. Most of the ideas and techniques covered in this notebook are derived from public notebooks and blog posts.
